        <h2>The bio</h2>
        <p>Ever imagined the word Somali put in the same place with Hiphop? Me too.
             Never in my life. Not until i had of <strong>hanadz band.</strong></p>
           <p> This is a group of young Somali boys who were raised in Kenya.
             They later relocated to the United States of America at a young age.</p> 
            <p>The fact that we have the same ethnic background in addition to the fact the fact 
                that my favourite music is hip hop makes them my all  time favourites.</p>
                <p>They rose to fame in 2018 and and tool <strong>Minnesota State</strong> in the united state.</p>
